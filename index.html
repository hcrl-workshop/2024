      <p>
       Representation learning has become a key research area in machine learning and artificial intelligence, with the goal of automatically learning useful and meaningful representations of data for a wide range of tasks. However, traditional representation learning approaches often fail to consider the human perspective and context, leading to representations that may not be interpretable or relevant for both models and humans. For example, in self-supervised learning, contrastive methods and masked autoencoders operate on the sample level and do not account for multiple views/modalities that belong to the same person.</p>
      <p>
We invite researchers, practitioners, and industry experts to submit original and unpublished research papers, case studies, and/or technical reports on all aspects of human-centric representation learning for real-world data (beyond commonly used benchmarks). HCRL aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working on representation learning approaches that explicitly consider the human perspective, preferences, priorities and context, and that are designed to address real-world problems and challenges.
